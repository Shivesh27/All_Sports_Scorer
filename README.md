# All_Sports_Scorer
Whether it’s a street cricket match or a tournament match going on in college or anywhere else. The main thing needed in any sports is the score. It keeps track of how the teams played and the status of the match,who is  winning or losing. Major matches have score calculators to keep an eye on the match and get a detailed scoreboard of the match,they note down the score on a paper . But that is always not the case.

So our application does the job of maintaining a perfect scorecard for you. Only the referee needs to enter the scores while the match is going on. 

For Example lets take a cricket match. The application asks for the team names and who won the toss and who bats first. After every ball it prompts what the ball scored, is it a dot or six or four or wide etc. It will have a minimal UI so that your only job is to press the button whether it’s a six or any other. This makes it easy for the scorer to record the score. And it reduces the human errors. It will be simple so that any one from the streets to tournaments would use it with an ease.
